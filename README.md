# Trip Planner

## Overview
This project gave me the opportunity to put all of the skills I have learned into one project to build my own custom travel app. Due to the nature of this course, it was very JavaScript heavy, but it was still expected I create clean and appealing HTML/CSS. I was targeting the DOM, working with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers.


## Instruction
Type in the city name and date of your departure of the trip.  It will retrieve whether info of the destination and city image through APIs. If the trip is within one week, it will display the current weather info and if the trip date is further than a week, it will display forecast weather info.

## What I learned
By completing this project, I learned how to use async function and promises. By utilizing async function, I was able to change promises to trigger next event based on successfuly execution of the previous functions.  For example, once fetch function to get weather data is correctly processed, then POST route is triggered to input the data into the end point.
