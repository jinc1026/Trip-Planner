# Trip Planner

## Overview
This project gave me the opportunity to put all of the skills I have learned into one project to build my own custom travel app. Due to the nature of this course, it was very JavaScript heavy, but it was still expected I create clean and appealing HTML/CSS. I was targeting the DOM, working with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers.


## Instruction
Type in the zipcode that you'd like to get the weather info about and also type in your feeling!
The app will get show the weather info and temperature on the bottom of the page.

## What I learned
By completing this project, I learned how to use async function and promises. By utilizing async function, I was able to change promises to trigger next event based on successfuly execution of the previous functions.  For example, once fetch function to get weather data is correctly processed, then POST route is triggered to input the data into the end point. 

Because it was my first time developing an app utilizing API, it gave me a lot of thoughts about the endless posibilities of web-developemt and applications.
